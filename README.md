# Thunders Aseprite Scripts
Scripts that I've written to help me automate repetitive tasks in Aseprite.

you can find more useful scripts and instructions on how to install/use them [in this thread (link)](https://community.aseprite.org/t/aseprite-scripts-collection/3599)


## save_tags_as_gifs.lua

saves tags as gifs and appends "_tagname" to each exported gif.

special cases:
- if the tag starts with "!" it's ignored (not exported)
- if the tag starts with "#" the sprite is cropped before export
